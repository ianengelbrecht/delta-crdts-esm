# delta-crdts-esm

An ESM port of [delta-crdts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/delta-crdts), just to make it a bit easier to work with, and with some updates to newer dependencies. See that page for the docs. 

Note these differences from that documentation:
- `lwwreg.write()` takes two parameters, timestamp and value.
